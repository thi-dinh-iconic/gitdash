## [3.1.0] — 2026-03-08

### Overview
UI/UX overhaul: responsive mobile navigation, redesigned settings page, global footer, skeleton loading states, demo mode, test infrastructure, and a completely rewritten README with intro video and walkthrough demo.

---

### Added

#### Mobile-Responsive Navigation
- **Mobile hamburger menu** with slide-out drawer, backdrop blur overlay, and close button
- **Sticky mobile top bar** with GitDash branding
- Desktop sidebar now uses sticky positioning with proper full-height background — no more gap between nav and page content
- Sidebar user account section pinned to bottom of viewport

#### Global Footer
- Consistent footer on all pages (except `/docs` which has its own) showing version, "Open source on GitHub" and "Report an issue" links
- Version pulled dynamically from `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION`

#### Settings Page — Complete Redesign
- Replaced narrow single-column layout with full-width responsive design
- **Account section**: horizontal card with avatar, name, mode badge, active status, and inline PAT management
- **Feature Flags**: responsive card grid (1/2/4 columns) replacing flat toggle list — cards are fully clickable with violet highlight when enabled
- **Enable all / Disable all** bulk toggle buttons
- Larger, more accessible "Change PAT" and "Clear & reset" buttons matching design system

#### Demo Mode
- New `/demo` page and `/api/demo` route for showcasing GitDash without a real GitHub token
- Demo data generator in `src/lib/demo.ts`

#### Skeleton Loading States
- Loading skeletons for all major pages: homepage, repo detail, workflow detail, cost analytics, docs
- `PageSkeleton` reusable component for consistent loading UX

#### New Components
- `MissionControl` — real-time system status overview
- `OnboardingChecklist` — guided first-run experience
- `MetricProvenance` — data source attribution for metrics
- `PageHeader` — standardized page header component
- Shell components: `PrimaryRail`, `WorkspacePanel`, `MobileNavDrawer`, `nav-config`

- README completely rewritten: video embeds, collapsible screenshot sections, cleaner structure with emoji section headers

---

### Improved

#### Layout & Sidebar
- Sidebar background now extends full page height (fixed `h-screen` gap issue)
- `flex-1` spacer ensures user account is always pinned to sidebar bottom
- AppShell uses `items-stretch` with separate outer wrapper for background vs sticky scroll behavior
- Docs page removed from full-page route exclusion (now renders within AppShell)

#### Cost Analytics

---

## [3.0.0] — 2026-03-07

### Overview
Major release: Feature Flags system, DORA metrics on repository overview, PR lifecycle health, historical DB-backed reporting, alert rules engine, and comprehensive built-in documentation.

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-03-01

### Overview
Automated Vercel deployment via GitHub Actions CI/CD, setup and login page improvements including PAT security transparency and author attribution.

---

### Added

#### Vercel Deployment Workflow
- New `.github/workflows/vercel.yml` — deploys to Vercel production automatically on every push to `main`, and can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`
- Uses `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` GitHub secrets (no CLI login required)
- Build step runs `vercel build --prod` in CI before deploying the prebuilt output — consistent reproducible deploys

#### Setup Page — PAT Security Section
- New "How this application handles your PAT?" section below the token scopes list
- Plain-English explanation: encrypted session cookie, never stored or forwarded to third parties
- Links to the README PAT security policy anchor

#### Author & License Attribution
- Footer of setup page now shows: `MIT License · Made by Dinh Do Ba Thi`
- Footer of login page updated to match for consistency

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-03-01

### Overview
Post-release polish: personal account billing support in Cost Analytics, fully-structured loading skeletons on every page, and a shimmer sweep animation replacing the invisible pulse effect.

---

### Added

#### Cost Analytics — Personal Account Billing
- **Personal Account** option added as the first entry in the Cost Analytics account dropdown
- Defaults to Personal Account on load — no org selection needed to see your own metered usage
- Calls `GET /users/{login}/settings/billing/usage/summary` (Enhanced Billing API) when Personal Account is selected
- Org entries remain available below a divider for switching to org billing
- Context banner now shows "Personal Account" label with a User icon (vs Building2 for orgs)

#### Shimmer Loading Animation
- New `@keyframes shimmer` + `.skeleton` CSS utility class in `globals.css`
- A bright highlight sweeps left→right across each placeholder shape (slate-800 → slate-700 → slate-800) at 1.6 s, matching the loading style used by GitHub, Linear, and similar apps
- Single utility: `class="skeleton rounded-*"` — border-radius controlled independently per shape

---

### Improved

#### Loading Skeletons — Audit Trail page
- Replaced 8 identical `h-16` blobs with a fully-structured skeleton:
  - 4 stat cards (icon + label + large value + sub-label)
  - Timeline card with header lines + 8 commit rows each showing avatar circle, varying-width message line, author · time · file-badge meta row, and SHA chip

#### Loading Skeletons — Security page
- Replaced 5 uniform `h-24` + 3 `h-16` blobs with a fully-structured skeleton:
  - Score ring card (large circle + 3 text lines) + 4 severity count cards in the summary strip
  - Section heading + 4 workflow file result rows with mini ring, file path, badge pills, check-mark row, and chevron

#### Loading Skeletons — All pages
- Fixed invisible pulse: all skeleton shapes were using `bg-slate-800` on a `bg-slate-900` background — near-zero contrast, making `animate-pulse` imperceptible
- Bumped all skeleton fill colours to `bg-slate-700` (and subsequently replaced with `.skeleton` shimmer)
- Migrated all pages from `animate-pulse bg-slate-700` to `.skeleton` class: homepage, repo detail, workflow detail, cost-analytics, org overview, team, audit trail, security, settings

---

### Fixed

#### Cost Analytics — 404 error clarity
- GitHub returns `404` (not `403`) when a PAT lacks org billing permission — the resource is hidden entirely
- Error block now clearly states "Your API key does not have enough permission" with the org name
- Explains the 404 behaviour, lists 4 actionable fix steps, and provides CTA buttons to create a fine-grained PAT and view org billing directly

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-01

### Overview
Major release adding executive-level analytics, team productivity metrics, security scanning, resource optimization insights, audit trail, and a suite of UX quick-wins. All features are stateless — no database required.

#### Health Score Ring (Quick Win)
- `HealthScoreRing` SVG radial ring component in `src/components/WorkflowMetrics.tsx`
- Composite score (0–100): 60 % success rate + 30 % stability + 10 % activity bonus
- Color thresholds: green ≥80, yellow ≥60, orange ≥40, red <40
- Replaces flat `HealthBadge` in workflow rows on the repo detail page (homepage retains `HealthBadge`)

#### Recent Failures Widget (Quick Win)
- Banner on the homepage listing repos with `failure` or `cancelled` conclusions in the last 24 h
- Reads from the SWR in-memory cache — zero additional API calls
- Capped at 5 entries; each links directly to the repo detail page with relative time
- Dismissible with ✕ button

#### Keyboard Shortcuts Modal (Quick Win)

---

### Changed

- **Sidebar version badge** — upgraded from a small muted `v0.1.0` label to a prominent violet pill linking to the GitHub Releases page
- **Cost Analytics error handling** — 403 now shows an actionable amber block (not a generic 500) explaining fine-grained PAT requirement
- **Setup page** — added fine-grained PAT note for Cost Analytics (replaces old `admin:org` scope instruction)
- **Login page** — updated Cost Analytics scope note

---

### Fixed

- `ExternalLink` lucide icon was missing from the security page import — caused a TypeScript compile error
- Removed unused `detectRunnerOS` import from the workflow detail page (was imported alongside `estimateRunCost` but never referenced)
- `Date.now()` inside `useMemo` / `useRef` initial values — moved to module-level constants to satisfy the `react-hooks/purity` lint rule
- Audit Trail page: added **Back to repo** button (ArrowLeft icon) for easier navigation

---

### Security

- All new API routes follow the established pattern: session token retrieval → input validation via `src/lib/validation.ts` → `safeError()` for error responses → `Cache-Control: private` headers
- Security scan page: no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; all external links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- No secrets, tokens, or PII are stored or logged anywhere in the new code

---

### Skipped (require infrastructure not yet available)

- **5.1 Historical Data Storage** — requires a database (PostgreSQL / SQLite)
- **4.1 Smart Alerts** — requires a database + external services (SendGrid, Slack webhook)

---

## [0.1.0] — Initial Release

- Workflow-level metrics (job / step performance, trigger patterns)
- Reliability tracking (MTTR, failure streaks, flaky detection)
- PAT + OAuth authentication with iron-session
- Fuzzy repo search, auto-refresh, keyboard navigation
